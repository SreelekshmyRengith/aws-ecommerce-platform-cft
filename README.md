Design and Deployment of a Scalable and Secure
E-commerce Platform on AWS
Project Overview
The platform's architecture leverages key AWS services:
● Auto Scaling and EC2 for scalable compute resources,
● RDS (Relational Database Service) for secure, reliable database management,
● WAF (Web Application Firewall) to guard against security threats,
● CloudFront CDN for efficient content delivery, reducing latency for global users.
Key Phases of Implementation
1. Infrastructure Setup: This phase involved setting up the foundational network
and compute infrastructure using CloudFormation. Key components include
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, Internet Gateways,
and Security Groups. EC2 instances and an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
were configured to handle traffic and secure data transmission through HTTPS.
2. Application Security: To safeguard against threats like SQL Injection and
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), the project implemented AWS WAF along with
custom rules for additional security. The domain was managed with Route 53 for
DNS routing and SSL certificates via AWS Certificate Manager to secure
client-server communications.
3. Content Delivery and Performance Optimization: Using CloudFront CDN to
cache static assets and dynamic content, the platform ensures quick response
times for global users. Performance was further enhanced with GZIP
Compression and tailored cache configurations to reduce load times.
4. Testing and Monitoring: Load testing with JMeter simulated high traffic, and
AWS CloudWatch was utilized to monitor application metrics like CPU usage and
HTTP request latency. Alerts were configured for proactive responses to unusual
activity.

Architecture Design
The e-commerce platform architecture is built around a VPC for secure isolation, with
resources distributed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and
fault tolerance. Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts EC2 instances based on traffic
demand. RDS provides database management with encryption for security.
Conclusion and Improvements
The project effectively demonstrates AWS's managed services for building a scalable
and secure e-commerce platform. Proposed future improvements include reducing Auto
Scaling cooldown periods, introducing Predictive Scaling for proactive resource
allocation, and adding ElastiCache for additional performance optimization.
